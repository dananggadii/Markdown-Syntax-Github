## Headers
To create headers, add the pound/hash symbol (#) in front of your text. The number of pound symbols determines the header level.
```
#Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

## Emphasize text
Using italics in text is as easy as surrounding the target text with single asterisks (*) or single underscores (_). Just be sure to close an emphasis with the same character with which you opened it. Be observant of how you combine the use of asterisks and underscores. Here are several examples:
```
This is *italic* text.
This is also _italic_ text.
```
> This is italic text. This is also italic text.

Create bold text by using two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__).
```
This is **bold** text.
This is also __bold__ text.
```
> This is bold text. This is also bold text.
